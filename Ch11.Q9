Assume the existence of a BankAccount class with a method, getAvailable that returns the amount of available funds in the account (as an int), and a subclass, OverdraftedAccount, with two int instance variables:
*overdraftLimit that represents the amount of money the account holder can borrow from the account (i.e., the amount the account balance can go negative), and
*overdraftAmount, the amount of money already borrowed against the account.
Override the getAvailable method in OverdraftedAccount to return the amount of funds available (as returned by the getAvailable method of the BankAccount class) plus the overdraftLimit minus the overdraftAmount.

public int getAvailable() { 
    return super.getAvailable() + overdraftLimit - overdraftAmount;
}
