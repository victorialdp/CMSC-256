Regardless of the type of communication device, there must be a way to transmit and receive data.
Define a non-public interface, CommDevice, with two methods:
1. transmit, which accepts two parametersâ€”reference to a Destination object, and a String (in that order), and returns a boolean;
2. receive, which accepts a parameter of type Duration, and returns a reference to a String.

interface CommDevice{
    
    public boolean transmit(Destination a, String b);
    
    public String receive(Duration c);
    
}
